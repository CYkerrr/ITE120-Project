        <p class="post-text">If your New Year's resolution to start exercising more has fallen by the wayside, hiring a personal trainer can be a good way to hold yourself accountable. Because exercise is such an important part of cardiovascular health, the cost is worthwhile — especially when you consider the added benefits of working with a professional trainer.

            "A good personal trainer will create a balanced workout and teach you how to exercise safely to avoid injuries," says certified personal trainer Vijay A. Daryanani, a physical therapist with Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Outpatient Center. He always has his clients start with a dynamic warm-up, such as marching in place or sidestepping and doing arm swings, which helps loosen up the major muscle groups. "I'll also have them do some heel-to-toe walking to help fire up some of the smaller muscles," he says.

            People focused on heart health often prioritize exercise that raises their heart rate (cardio or aerobic exercise). But strength training builds lean muscle mass, which helps burn body fat, keeps blood sugar in check, and may help reduce cholesterol levels.

            Injury prevention<br />
            Using the proper form during strength-building exercises is key. The weight machines at gyms and fitness centers can be a good option for beginners because they target specific muscle groups within a limited range of motion, says Daryanani. But when you use free weights (dumbbells, barbells, and kettlebells), you use a much wider range of muscles, including core muscles and others that help with stability and balance. A trainer will help you choose the correct type and size of free weight, based on your abilities and goals. Because free weights allow a greater range of motion, you need good body awareness to stay safe.
            <br />
            
            Always make sure to stand up straight and tall before starting any standing strength moves, says Daryanani. Most gyms and health clubs have mirrors that you can use to get feedback on your form as you exercise. Even a basic body-weight exercise like a squat requires careful attention to body alignment to avoid straining your joints (see "The right and wrong way to do a squat").

            Proper form is crucial to protecting yourself from injury and getting the most benefit from an exercise. A squat is a classic body-weight exercise that strengthens the lower body and core muscles in addition to improving your balance and posture. Here's the correct way to do this exercise without stressing the joints in your hips, knees, and ankles.
            <br />
            Bend at your hips to work your gluteal (buttocks) muscles.
            Lean forward about 45° to keep your balance.
            Check that your knees are aligned and not rolling inward or outward.
            Keep your feet flat, with your heels on the floor.
            Don't let your knees go farther forward than your toes.
            Try not to let your thighs sink lower than parallel to the floor.
            Don't round your back; try to keep your spine in a straight line.
            <br />
            
            Choosing a personal trainer
            Some gyms and fitness centers have personal trainers on staff or hire them as contractors. But many will come to your house and can devise an at-home workout plan for you, even if you don't own any machines or special equipment. Look for one who's accredited by one or more of these organizations:
            <br />
            American Council on Exercise (ACE)
            American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)
            International Sports Sciences Association (ISSA)
            National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM).
            Ask about the person's training background, experience working with clients your age, and approach to designing client programs. Consider asking for references, especially from clients like you. Sign up for a few sessions at first to gauge how well you and the trainer work together before you commit to something longer.
            <br />
            
            Prices vary widely, depending on where you live and possibly gym affiliations. The cost ranges anywhere from $75 to $125 per hour. You might be able to save a little money by hiring a trainer to do small group sessions with you and one or several of your friends who have similar fitness levels and goals.
            <br />
            Another advantage to working with a trainer: a good one can make exercise feel like a fun challenge instead of a repetitive chore. "Getting someone in the right mindset is essential, and I find that positive energy can be very infectious," says Daryanani.</p>
