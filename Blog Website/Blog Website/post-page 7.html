        <p class="post-text">It’s no great mystery what has made Phuket Thailand’s most popular tourist destination. It is truly gifted with natural beauty, and traveling along the coast of Phuket, you’ll see one beautiful white sandy beach after the other, like pearls on a string.
            <br />
            But there is more to Phuket than just the stunning beaches; atmospheric old-colonial-style shops and restaurants, spectacular temples, lively nightlife, and so much more. Every little beach town has its distinct personality, and deciding where to stay in Phuket can feel quite overwhelming.
            
            <br />
            Whether you are looking for a family-friendly beach holiday, a secluded luxury getaway, or want to party the night away at Phuket’s famous nightlife, choosing the right place to stay can make or break your holiday.
