        <p class="post-text">When it comes to getting rest, it’s natural to think of crawling under the covers as a quick fix for exhaustion, sleepiness, and general world weariness. But not all forms of rest involve sleep—and it’s time we stop putting sleep and rest in the same category. “Both sleep and rest are beneficial and necessary,” says Patty Johnson, PsyD, clinical psychologist at Nia Integrative Healing. But “it’s important to differentiate between the two, because while sleep is vital for physical and cognitive functioning, rest is crucial for emotional and mental well-being," says therapist Sandra Kushnir, LMFT, founder and CEO of Meridian Counseling,

            In fact, some experts believe there are seven types of rest (none of which involve sleep, by the way) that we need to address to fully feel truly restored. Feeling rejuvenated creatively, for example, may involve going outside to museums, looking at art, listening to music, or being in nature—all things that very much do not involve being in bed.<br />
            
            Similarly, going for a meditative jog where you focus on your breathing, the cadence of your footsteps, and the sounds of nature around you may seem antithetical to resting and recuperating, but it can actually fill up your mental-rest stores far better than a day of napping. Skeptical? I get it, and it’s exactly why this information is so crucial to our health. So let’s get into it.<br />
            
            What is the difference between sleep and rest?
            While both are very necessary in the overall equation of a healthy life, knowing the difference between rest and sleep can help us better "succeed" at both of them.<br />
            
            Sleep
            “Sleep is a fundamental medical necessity,” says Kushnir. “It’s the foundation that allows our bodies and minds to function optimally.” While everyone has a different and unique range of sleep needs (some of us need eight hours, some of us need ten, and some of us—like me—would really prefer to get a solid twelve, if the world allowed), Kushnir adds that getting the right amount of sleep “is critical for your overall health and well-being, [as it] rejuvenates your body, aids in memory consolidation, and supports emotional regulation.” <br />
            
            Rest
            Rest, however, can mean any activity (yes, activity) that helps “soothe your limbic system and allows you to be present, creative, and free from the pressures of performance or work,” Kushnir says. Think of “rest” as actual activities, hobbies, connections, or bonds that can help you feel whole and rejuvenated. According to Kushnir, rest activities “provide a mental and emotional break, helping you recharge in a different way than sleep does.” <br />
            
            Your body also categorizes sleep and rest differently: “From a neurological standpoint, brain-wave activity during sleep is different than during rest,” says Johnson. "We’re able to tap into creative ideas or find clarity on a difficult issue while in a state of deep rest, but we're not able to process these tasks while asleep,” she says.<br />
            
            
            Is it possible to get sleep that isn’t restful?
            Unfortunately, it’s totally possible to get sleep that isn’t restful. Just ask anyone who wakes up several times in the middle of the night, or anyone who has had a fitful night of sleep thanks to weird dreams or certain health concerns. “Having conditions like sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome can make you feel less rested, even if you seemed to sleep the whole night,” says licensed clinical psychologist Jessica Ribeiro, PhD.<br />
            
            “Drinking alcohol, especially before sleep, can [also] result in waking up feeling less refreshed, since alcohol can reduce the amount of time you spend in REM sleep,” says Ribeiro. Sleep can also be interrupted by sound (a snoring partner, garbage trucks, barking dogs), discomfort (a mattress that’s too hot or cold), or motion (a partner that tosses and turns), says wellness expert and physician Greg Hammer, MD.<br />
            
            Okay, but why can't sleep count as rest?
            “We sometimes believe that if we get enough sleep, we don’t need to give ourselves time to rest,” says Ribeiro. “[But] this isn’t true, and the reality is that even if we’re getting a full night’s rest, we can still feel tired and run-down during the day if we aren’t allowing ourselves time to rest,” she says. For example: If what you really need is a creative or spiritual reset and recharge, all the sleep in the world may not fill your cup in a way that makes you feel fully rested.<br />
            
            “Another misconception is that the only way to get rest is to lie down or to take a nap,” Ribeiro says. While a nap can definitely be relaxing and restorative, it’s not the only way to get rest.
            
            Your beginner's guide to getting rest
            There's no right or wrong way to rest—as long as you're really, truly trying (so, ahem, no mindlessly watching TikToks and calling it "rest"). But if you're not sure where to start, you can:
            
            1. Try meditative practices
            Meditation is a great way to get rest without sleep. You can try traditional meditation, swaying gently, forest bathing, or even walking slowly and intentionally (i.e., meditative walking), says Johnson. 
            
            2. Appreciate your creativity
            Creative rest may also include activities such as painting your nails, singing, or watching the leaves rustle, says Johnson. Creative endeavors like “reading, journaling, knitting, or listening to music can also be soothing and help you feel rejuvenated,” Ribeiro says. 
            
            3. Dedicate a moment for self-care
            You can also partake in rest through self-care practices, such as taking a hot bath, as Ribeiro suggests. “Basically, anything that involves an inactive and relaxed state” can be restful, she says. If you have daylight hours and the ability to go outside, you can also spend time in nature, go for a gentle walk, or just sit outside to reduce stress and boost your mood, Ribeiro says. <br />
            
            4. Move your body
            “Some people also find physical activities, like yoga or stretching, to be restful and restorative,” says Ribeiro, while others may find something a bit more cardio-forward, like jogging, can also be restful and meditative if you focus on your breathing, cadence, and environment while doing it.
            
            Learning the differences can be crucial to your health
            “Thinking of sleep and rest as separate but equally important things can help us recognize that there are many different ways to recharge our batteries,” says Ribeiro. By recognizing the importance of both, “we can be more intentional about making time in our schedules for rest,” she says. And the more that we prioritize our rest, the better our sleep quality often becomes.<br />
            
            The end result of separating the two? You take a lot of the pressure off of sleep as a fix-all for everything in your life—which, in turn, leaves you with more energy to discover the areas of your life that may need a bit more TLC.</p>
