                Gravity-Powered Innovation Transforms Renewable Energy: Solar Panels That Cool and Water Themselves
            </a>
            <span class="post-date">5 Oct 2024</span>
            <p class="post-decription">Researchers in Saudi Arabia have created a new device that collects atmospheric water to cool solar cells without using electricity. This sustainable technology also promises reduced operational costs and can double water collection rates in arid regions.

                Saudi Arabia’s significant investment in solar cell technology, coupled with its plentiful sunlight, has effectively positioned it to become a major exporter of renewable energy. Solar power now constitutes over 80% of the Kingdom’s renewable energy output. However, there’s an inherent paradox: these solar cells risk overheating due to their intense operation. To combat this, cooling systems are essential, though many of these systems still rely on electricity.
                
                Innovative Cooling Solution
                An international research team led by KAUST Professor Qiaoqiang Gan has designed a potential solution. Their device needs no electricity, as it extracts water from the air using nothing more than gravity and relies on cheap, readily available materials. Along with keeping the solar cells and other semiconductor technologies cool, the water can be repurposed for irrigation, washing, cooling buildings on which the solar cells are placed, and other applications.
                
                Atmospheric Water Harvesting Advances
                Scientists estimate that the atmosphere contains six times more water than all the fresh water in the rivers combined. “This water can be collected by atmospheric water harvesting technologies,” says Gan. While these technologies work reasonably well, in arid environments like that of Saudi Arabia they require electricity to harvest practical amounts of water. This demand risks deterring the adoption of solar cells in rural regions of the Kingdom, where electricity infrastructure is costly.
                
                Enhancing Efficiency With a New Coating
                One reason for the low efficiency is that the water adheres to the surface of the harvesting device. Professor Dan Daniel and Shakeel Ahmad, a postdoc in Gan’s group, found that by adding a lubricant coating that is a mix of a commercial polymer and silicon oil, they could collect more water by relying on only gravity.
                
                “A common challenge in atmospheric water harvesting systems is that water droplets tend to remain pinned to the surface [of the device], necessitating active condensate collection. Our coating effectively eliminated pinning, enabling true passive water collection driven by water,” says Ahmad. “Since this system operates entirely on passive radiative cooling, it doesn’t consume any electricity.”
                
                The solution is based on previous technology made by Gan, which he describes as “vertical double-sided architecture.” That system was originally designed to reflect thermal heat back to the sky to keep the solar cells cool but not to capture the water produced.
                
                Economic and Environmental Benefits
                The new device was tested six times over the span of a year in natural conditions in the town of Thuwal, about 100 km north of Jeddah, and could almost double the rate of water collection compared with alternative atmospheric water harvesting technologies.
                
                Along with the efficiency of the water collection, Daniel is equally excited about the economic benefits of adopting.
                
                “The system doesn’t consume any electricity, leading to energy savings. Moreover, it doesn’t rely on any mechanical parts like compressors or fans, reducing the maintenance over traditional systems, leading to further savings,” he said.

                The cloud is so vast that there’s no shortage of topics to learn. But that can make finding your starting point all the more difficult. 
                
                Luckily, Prasad Rao, AWS Principal Solutions Architect; Ashish Prajapati, AWS Senior Technical Instructor; and Lucy Wang, Founder of Tech with Lucy, are here to share their cloud career tips. They share their advice for earning cloud computing jobs, including cloud skills, certifications, and learning strategies.

                What is the basic knowledge required to learn cloud computing?
                Start learning fundamental cloud computing concepts and skills before diving into niche topics or emerging technologies like AI. 
                
                “Before jumping the gun, ensure that you have the fundamentals sorted, especially for people who are coming from non-technical backgrounds,” said Prasad. “Understand core services, compute, databases, networking, security. . . . Once you know these, then it will be easier for you to advance.”
                
                As Ashish noted, “You can't build a tall building without having a solid foundation, and the same applies to a career, your knowledge, [and] your skills.”
                
                Do I need specialized cloud skills?
                As you learn cloud basics, you’ll uncover the areas that interest you most. This can help you determine your cloud computing career and direct your future learning efforts.
                
                “Cloud is such a vast space that you have to pick and choose the kind of specialty you would like to go [into],” explained Prasad. “You might go into infrastructure management. In that case, you might think about IaC tools for automation. You might want to go into DevOps, then you need to choose [what to learn] accordingly.”
                
                Focusing on a specialized area of cloud can also set you apart from other applicants when you’re ready to apply for cloud jobs. “Cloud skills are still in demand. If you can pair that foundational knowledge with something that you're interested in, for example, security, AI, anything like that, that can also help cloud learners stand out,” said Lucy.
                
                
                What soft skills do I need for cloud computing jobs?
                You’ll need soft skills for a cloud computing career, whether you become a cloud architect, cloud engineer, or cloud security specialist. The exact soft skills you need will vary depending on your role, but focusing on the customer will help you determine which skills to hone.
                
                “There's so many things that can be done in the cloud, but understand what the requirements are for the customers and work backwards from there. Think about how you can add value. And that's where your problem solving and analytical skills come into the picture. That's where your communication and collaboration come into the picture,” said Prasad.

                Are cloud certifications worth it?
                When it comes to cloud certifications, some people say they’re extremely important and some say they’re useless. What’s the truth? 
                
                “Certifications do two things. They first provide you with a clear structured roadmap for you to learn everything you need to learn to build a good cloud foundation. But also, [they help] you with extra credibility,” explained Lucy.
                
                “Sometimes when you're applying to companies, when they see that you have a certification, it could be a bonus for the resume, especially if you haven't had previous cloud experience.”
                
                But don’t consider them the only option for landing cloud computing jobs. “If people rely too much on certifications, then they're focusing too much on the theory, which means that they might not have actually had experience with building things and actually implementing or seeing these services in the console at all,” added Lucy.
                
                That’s why it’s important to augment certifications with hands-on experience. Build a web application or complete a hands-on project like the cloud resume challenge to showcase on your resume.
                
                Which cloud certification is best?
                If you’re a cloud beginner with a non-technical background, Lucy recommends earning foundational certifications in one of the three major cloud providers:
                
                AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
                
                Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)
                
                Google Cloud Digital Leader
                
                If you already have technical experience or want to challenge yourself, move to the associate level certifications.
                
                AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate
                
                Microsoft Azure Developer Associate (AZ-204)
                
                Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer
                
                Is it good to get multiple cloud certifications?
                It’s always impressive when people hold multiple certifications. But the types of certs you earn—and how relevant they are to the cloud computing jobs you want—are more important than the sheer number you have.
                
                Ashish advises starting with foundational certifications and then moving on to more specialized certifications based on your interests. “If I'm more into analytics, if I'm more into security, if I'm more into networking, I would look for those certifications rather than being in a rat race where I am just pursuing certifications without understanding what they are,” he said.
                
                If you still want to earn ten cloud certifications in three months, go for it! Just consider the renewal process. “After three years, all ten will expire at the same time. Are you willing to renew those ten certifications in that time frame again?” asked Ashish.
                
                Most of us have limited learning time. Maximize the long-term value of your certifications by focusing on those most relevant to your desired cloud role.
                
                Get advice from folks who used certifications as a launching pad to a cloud computing career. 
                
                Do I need a mentor to get cloud computing jobs?
                A cloud computing career mentor isn’t necessary, but having one can help you make the most of your learning and offer support and encouragement.
                
                “If you can, try to find a mentor along the journey,” said Lucy. “It's not completely necessary, but it definitely helps you try to figure out what to learn and what not to learn and how to just optimize your journey.”
                
                If you can’t find a mentor, try to get involved in the cloud community in other ways. “You can go on to meetup.com and then look at the different events out there. Different cloud companies also have summits and conferences throughout the year, sometimes in your local area as well.
                
                "So that's something I would recommend doing, like going there and also trying to network and meet people who are at a similar journey and career stages as you potentially with similar goals,” said Lucy.
                
                How important is social media for getting a cloud job?
                Social media can be a valuable tool to showcase your skills to potential employers and connect with the cloud community. As you learn, share your progress on social media like LinkedIn. 
                
                “The community is so supportive that if you are doing something right, they would be giving you a thumbs up and rallying behind you,” said Prasad. “Let’s say you've done a very basic three tier web setup, and you have shared the step-by-step process that you have done. People would be coming up with both a positive response and constructive feedback about what you can do better. 
                
                “And that really helps. It helps not only for you to gain understanding, but also it helps you in [gaining] the visibility that would be required for breaking into the cloud. . . . Potential employers are watching you when you're sharing the little nuggets of wisdom that you have gained while you're on that journey. They would see that you're actually doing the practical hands on.”

                Scientists reexamine dopamine’s role in the placebo effect
            </a>
            <span class="post-date">24 Sep 2024</span>
            <p class="post-decription">The placebo effect can have a significant influence on treatment outcomes. While we still have a lot to learn about how and why a patient’s expectations can influence the effectiveness of medication or treatment, we know that this is the case. “There is ample evidence that placebo effects in general, and placebo analgesia in particular, are not merely a ‘psychological’ effect, but underpinned by complex neurobiological phenomena,” Ulrike Bingel, a co-author of a new paper published September 24 in PLoS Biology, tells Popular Science. 

                These neurobiological phenomena remain a topic of active research. One proposed explanation is that the expectation that a treatment will be effective activates the brain’s mesolimbic pathway—the system that provides a sense of motivation to carry out an action, and a sense of reward and satisfaction when the action is done. This system relies on the neurotransmitter dopamine, and the experiment that Bingel and her team document in the paper tested the hypothesis that “dopamine-based reward and learning mechanisms … contribute to placebo effects.” 
        
                
                [ Related: In painkiller trials, placebo effect is becoming more powerful ]
                
                
                
                Specifically, the researchers studied how the brain’s dopamine levels affected the effectiveness of placebo analgesia (i.e. placebo pain relief.) To do this, they divided participants into two groups. One was given a dopamine agonist drug beforehand, suppressing the level of dopamine in their brains; the other was given dopamine precursor L-dopa, effectively increasing their dopamine levels. Each group was then given a heat-based pain stimulus, and administered identical placebo-based pain relief. To their surprise, the team found that the effectiveness of the placebo analgesia did not seem to be contingent on participants’ dopamine levels.
                
                This suggests that ambient dopamine levels in the brain do not influence the strength of the placebo effect. However, given dopamine’s importance to the brain’s reward pathways, its apparent lack of influence on placebo analgesia also raises the question of how those pathways are involved in the phenomenon. Bingel notes that this is not a question that the study addressed directly: “We can talk solely about the neurotransmitter dopamine; we can’t say anything about the distinct neurobiological [reward] circuitry as we did not perform brain imaging.” However, she says, “[Dopaminergic] pathways are very well described and based on previous evidence it is at least fair to speculate about their involvement.”
                
                The situation with analgesia is complicated by the fact that dopamine is also involved in the actual phenomenon of pain relief. “Any pain relief is inherently rewarding,” agrees  Bingel. “As such, [it] likely involves dopaminergic pathways.” She says that this might also explain previous research that suggested dopamine is involved in placebo analgesia: “Our study shows that this involvement of dopaminergic pathways is not causally involved in the analgesia part. It might be an epiphenomenon,” or a secondary phenomenon that results from and accompanies a primary cause. 
                
                
                
                Popular parlance tends to refer to “the placebo effect” as a single phenomenon, but scientists tend to view various placebo-related effects as separate phenomena that share a common neurobiological foundation. “This neurobiological foundation is not limited to placebo analgesia,” explains Bingel. “It is recognized for many placebo effects, although placebo analgesia is probably the best studied to date.”
                
                Quite where the common foundation ends and separate effects begin, however, remains an open question. For example, to what extent does a placebo for pain work in the same way as a placebo for, say, depression?
                
                “This is an excellent question,” says Bingel. “Particularly for pain and depression, there may be overlapping brain networks responsible for placebo effects. However, to date, the two mechanisms [have not been] compared directly. We will hopefully know within the next few years which common/joint and distinct neural circuitry underlie placebo effects in pain and negative affect/depression.”
                
                Another variable here is that while, by their nature, placebo effects depend on a patient’s expectation of a positive outcome, they may also depend on the strength of a patient’s desire for a positive outcome. Bingel notes that in the context of the paper, participants’ desire for pain relief were relatively low. They were, after all, willing participants in a study, and the pain they experienced was relatively mild. “In our study, participants only passively received analgesia, and the motivation/desire for pain relief can be assumed to be low in this highly controlled, experimental context in healthy volunteers.”
                
                
                
                Clearly, the situation is very different for people experiencing actual chronic pain from which they are desperate for relief, and Bingel says that in such cases, reward pathways may play a different role. “While our results make a causal role of dopamine in this particular context very unlikely, it does not exclude that dopamine may play a role in different motivational context (as can be assumed in patients suffering from chronic pain), or if more ‘active control’ or ‘agency’ is involved in the treatment.”
                
                
                
                Given the many subtleties of how placebo phenomena work, it’s not surprising that the subject remains the topic of much active research. Bingel says that a better understanding of how placebo effects work is crucial for incorporating into treatments: “Pharmacological strategies of tomorrow should harness the valuable interaction of endogenous pharmacology (evident in placebo effects) and specific medical treatments, such as drug treatments. [But] we can only target the placebo effect systematically if we understand its mechanisms.”</p>

                6 Steps To Improve Indoor Air Quality This Fall (Why You Should)
            </a>
            <span class="post-date">3 Oct 2024</span>
            <p class="post-decription">As autumn arrives with its cooler temperatures and a kaleidoscope of colored foliage, you and your loved ones are probably ready to embrace the seasonal activities that make this time of year so special. 

                
                From warming up by the fire to taking crisp strolls through apple orchards or pumpkin patches, fall is a season packed full of all things comfort and coziness. However, as you dive into themed decor and tasty treats during the upcoming months, it's crucial to focus on something less visible but equally important: ensuring healthy indoor air quality for you and your family.
                
                Why? The average person breathes 20,000 breaths daily and spends around 90% of their time indoors1. While it's not a factor we often consider, indoor air is one of the main routes of exposure we face. If that air is packed full of microscopic particles like mold spores, bacteria2, or mycotoxins (toxins produced by certain types of fungi), it will negatively impact our health.

                Every time you inhale, contaminants enter your body thanks to their small size. Some particles, like mycotoxins, are so small that they can bypass your lungs and go straight into your bloodstream. The longer toxic air surrounds you, the more unhealthy stuff your body will be exposed to. Your immune system will attempt to keep up and eliminate them, but it's a tall order to fill. Over time, the immune system can get overwhelmed or malfunction, leading to chronic inflammation3 and a long list of possible symptoms.
                
           
                
                Working to reduce opportunities for indoor contaminants can help keep our indoor air quality clean and healthy.
                
                Fall's fluctuating temperatures, unpredictable weather, and bouts of humidity can trigger issues like microbial growth indoors. Consider these six steps for this season to protect your home and maintain a safe living environment with healthy air quality:
                
                1. Optimize your HVAC system
                As the seasons change, it's incredibly important to prioritize the HVAC system. As the "lungs of the home," this unit has the power to seriously impact your indoor air quality. If it's harboring contamination like mold or bacteria, it will spread particles such as mold spores, bacteria, and mycotoxins throughout the entire indoor space.
                
                To prevent this air quality hazard, schedule a comprehensive inspection and tuneup of your HVAC system by a certified professional before transitioning from cooling to heating. This preventive step helps ensure your system is free of contaminants and ready for the cooler months ahead.

                Here is a quick list you can ask them to tackle:
                
                Test for mold
                Clean the coil, blower, furnace, and cabinets
                Ensure everything is operating correctly 
                Think of it as a biannual health checkup for your home's respiratory system.
                
                Pro tip: As an added layer of protection, replace your air filters with the highest-rated MERV filters the unit can handle. This reduces the risk of harmful particles circulating into your HVAC and throughout your home. Make sure to replace these on time, as a dirty filter will not effectively eliminate particles.
                
                2. Defend against moisture
                Moisture4 is the primary culprit behind mold growth, making it crucial to keep it out of your home. As fall often brings rainstorms and larger weather-related events, it is the perfect time to inspect your home's exterior for any issues that could allow moisture to seep in. Examine the foundation for cracks, check the roof for damaged shingles, and inspect windows and doors for gaps in the seals. Addressing these issues before winter arrives is also a layer of protection against ice and snow, so it's a double win!
                
                This is also incredibly important for homes in areas prone to intense storms like hurricanes, which ramp up during September and into October. The more you protect your home against strong gusts of winds and flooding, the safer and healthier your indoor air quality will remain.

                3. Ensure proper gutter maintenance
                Autumn's falling leaves, while beautiful, can wreak havoc on your gutters. Clogged gutters can lead to water overflow, damaging your home's foundation and causing leaks around areas like windows. This can create ideal conditions for microbial growth, especially in areas that remain damp for extended periods.
                
                Regularly cleaning your gutters throughout the fall will help maintain proper drainage and protect your home from potential water damage. For added protection, consider installing gutter guards and/or extensions to direct water farther away from your home's foundation.
                
                4. Prepare your fireplace for the season
                As the temperature drops, many people look forward to lighting their fireplaces. However, before you do, it's essential to have your fireplace5 and chimney inspected. Over the summer, debris such as leaves or nests can block the chimney, while creosote buildup from previous fires can present a significant fire hazard.
                
                All of these will add harmful particulate matter and chemicals into your indoor air whenever you light a fire. Lack of ventilation from damages or other structural issues will also result in the particle-filled air making its way inside your home, instead of up the chimney and outdoors. Not to mention other issues, such as microbial growth, can develop in this location, further adding to the contamination being released into your indoor air.

                A professional chimney sweep will clear any blockages and check for structural damage that could allow water to enter your home. Ensuring your fireplace is in good condition will help you enjoy a cozy, warm atmosphere while maintaining a healthy indoor environment.
                
                5. Tackle dust 
                Dust is more than just a nuisance; it can harbor mold spores, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and other allergens6, contributing to poor indoor air quality. Regular cleaning is essential to minimize these risks and maintain a healthy home environment. Fall, particularly, can increase dust in your home because there are more particles outdoors from decaying matter like leaves.
                
                To clean thoroughly, use slightly damp microfiber cloths and a vacuum with a HEPA filter. For an added layer of protection, consider testing the dust in your home for hidden contaminants before removing it. Tools like The Dust Test can provide insights into what's lurking in your dust, helping you take targeted action to improve your indoor environment if it indicates a current source of microbial growth.
                
                6. Store warmer weather items properly
                When cooler weather hits, it will be time to switch out all that summer clothing, sunny decor, and other seasonal items for things more geared toward fall. One key way to avoid water damage, mold, and poor indoor air quality is to store items properly. Place everything in sealed containers that are waterproof and easy to clean. Cardboard boxes are not the best option. If these items become wet, they'll become perfect homes for microbial growth. Another layer of protection is to store them off the ground on stainless steel racks with ventilation to allow airflow and avoid becoming wet from issues such as leaks.

                Special care should also be taken for water-related belongings like pool toys, garden hoses, and floats. If left damp when tossed into storage, these items can easily become breeding grounds for mold and bacteria, impacting the items themselves and causing harmful exposures later on. Before putting these items away, make sure everything is thoroughly dried, and then store them in a dry area, preferably in waterproof containers when possible.
                
                Speaking of fall and seasonal decor, wipe off and clean all items brought out from storage to remove particles like dust and mold spores.
                
                Prioritize home health this fall
                While indulging in the joys of the fall season, it's important not to neglect the health of your home. By proactively implementing these steps, you can safeguard your living environment against poor indoor air quality, ensuring your home will be a safe space for you and your family.

                Why We Need to Stop Conflating Sleep With Rest
            </a>
            <span class="post-date">6 September 2024</span>
            <p class="post-decription">When it comes to getting rest, it’s natural to think of crawling under the covers as a quick fix for exhaustion, sleepiness, and general world weariness. But not all forms of rest involve sleep—and it’s time we stop putting sleep and rest in the same category. “Both sleep and rest are beneficial and necessary,” says Patty Johnson, PsyD, clinical psychologist at Nia Integrative Healing. But “it’s important to differentiate between the two, because while sleep is vital for physical and cognitive functioning, rest is crucial for emotional and mental well-being," says therapist Sandra Kushnir, LMFT, founder and CEO of Meridian Counseling,

                In fact, some experts believe there are seven types of rest (none of which involve sleep, by the way) that we need to address to fully feel truly restored. Feeling rejuvenated creatively, for example, may involve going outside to museums, looking at art, listening to music, or being in nature—all things that very much do not involve being in bed.
                
                Similarly, going for a meditative jog where you focus on your breathing, the cadence of your footsteps, and the sounds of nature around you may seem antithetical to resting and recuperating, but it can actually fill up your mental-rest stores far better than a day of napping. Skeptical? I get it, and it’s exactly why this information is so crucial to our health. So let’s get into it.
                
                What is the difference between sleep and rest?
                While both are very necessary in the overall equation of a healthy life, knowing the difference between rest and sleep can help us better "succeed" at both of them.
                
                Sleep
                “Sleep is a fundamental medical necessity,” says Kushnir. “It’s the foundation that allows our bodies and minds to function optimally.” While everyone has a different and unique range of sleep needs (some of us need eight hours, some of us need ten, and some of us—like me—would really prefer to get a solid twelve, if the world allowed), Kushnir adds that getting the right amount of sleep “is critical for your overall health and well-being, [as it] rejuvenates your body, aids in memory consolidation, and supports emotional regulation.” 
                
                Rest
                Rest, however, can mean any activity (yes, activity) that helps “soothe your limbic system and allows you to be present, creative, and free from the pressures of performance or work,” Kushnir says. Think of “rest” as actual activities, hobbies, connections, or bonds that can help you feel whole and rejuvenated. According to Kushnir, rest activities “provide a mental and emotional break, helping you recharge in a different way than sleep does.” 
                
                Your body also categorizes sleep and rest differently: “From a neurological standpoint, brain-wave activity during sleep is different than during rest,” says Johnson. "We’re able to tap into creative ideas or find clarity on a difficult issue while in a state of deep rest, but we're not able to process these tasks while asleep,” she says.
                
                
                Is it possible to get sleep that isn’t restful?
                Unfortunately, it’s totally possible to get sleep that isn’t restful. Just ask anyone who wakes up several times in the middle of the night, or anyone who has had a fitful night of sleep thanks to weird dreams or certain health concerns. “Having conditions like sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome can make you feel less rested, even if you seemed to sleep the whole night,” says licensed clinical psychologist Jessica Ribeiro, PhD.
                
                “Drinking alcohol, especially before sleep, can [also] result in waking up feeling less refreshed, since alcohol can reduce the amount of time you spend in REM sleep,” says Ribeiro. Sleep can also be interrupted by sound (a snoring partner, garbage trucks, barking dogs), discomfort (a mattress that’s too hot or cold), or motion (a partner that tosses and turns), says wellness expert and physician Greg Hammer, MD.
                
                Okay, but why can't sleep count as rest?
                “We sometimes believe that if we get enough sleep, we don’t need to give ourselves time to rest,” says Ribeiro. “[But] this isn’t true, and the reality is that even if we’re getting a full night’s rest, we can still feel tired and run-down during the day if we aren’t allowing ourselves time to rest,” she says. For example: If what you really need is a creative or spiritual reset and recharge, all the sleep in the world may not fill your cup in a way that makes you feel fully rested.
                
                “Another misconception is that the only way to get rest is to lie down or to take a nap,” Ribeiro says. While a nap can definitely be relaxing and restorative, it’s not the only way to get rest.
                
                Your beginner's guide to getting rest
                There's no right or wrong way to rest—as long as you're really, truly trying (so, ahem, no mindlessly watching TikToks and calling it "rest"). But if you're not sure where to start, you can:
                
                1. Try meditative practices
                Meditation is a great way to get rest without sleep. You can try traditional meditation, swaying gently, forest bathing, or even walking slowly and intentionally (i.e., meditative walking), says Johnson. 
                
                2. Appreciate your creativity
                Creative rest may also include activities such as painting your nails, singing, or watching the leaves rustle, says Johnson. Creative endeavors like “reading, journaling, knitting, or listening to music can also be soothing and help you feel rejuvenated,” Ribeiro says. 
                
                3. Dedicate a moment for self-care
                You can also partake in rest through self-care practices, such as taking a hot bath, as Ribeiro suggests. “Basically, anything that involves an inactive and relaxed state” can be restful, she says. If you have daylight hours and the ability to go outside, you can also spend time in nature, go for a gentle walk, or just sit outside to reduce stress and boost your mood, Ribeiro says. 
                
                4. Move your body
                “Some people also find physical activities, like yoga or stretching, to be restful and restorative,” says Ribeiro, while others may find something a bit more cardio-forward, like jogging, can also be restful and meditative if you focus on your breathing, cadence, and environment while doing it.
                
                Learning the differences can be crucial to your health
                “Thinking of sleep and rest as separate but equally important things can help us recognize that there are many different ways to recharge our batteries,” says Ribeiro. By recognizing the importance of both, “we can be more intentional about making time in our schedules for rest,” she says. And the more that we prioritize our rest, the better our sleep quality often becomes.
                
                The end result of separating the two? You take a lot of the pressure off of sleep as a fix-all for everything in your life—which, in turn, leaves you with more energy to discover the areas of your life that may need a bit more TLC.</p>

                How A Personal Trainer Can Enhance Your Workouts
            </a>
            <span class="post-date">1 Feb 2024</span>
            <p class="post-decription">If your New Year's resolution to start exercising more has fallen by the wayside, hiring a personal trainer can be a good way to hold yourself accountable. Because exercise is such an important part of cardiovascular health, the cost is worthwhile — especially when you consider the added benefits of working with a professional trainer.

                "A good personal trainer will create a balanced workout and teach you how to exercise safely to avoid injuries," says certified personal trainer Vijay A. Daryanani, a physical therapist with Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Outpatient Center. He always has his clients start with a dynamic warm-up, such as marching in place or sidestepping and doing arm swings, which helps loosen up the major muscle groups. "I'll also have them do some heel-to-toe walking to help fire up some of the smaller muscles," he says.
                
                People focused on heart health often prioritize exercise that raises their heart rate (cardio or aerobic exercise). But strength training builds lean muscle mass, which helps burn body fat, keeps blood sugar in check, and may help reduce cholesterol levels.
                
                Injury prevention
                Using the proper form during strength-building exercises is key. The weight machines at gyms and fitness centers can be a good option for beginners because they target specific muscle groups within a limited range of motion, says Daryanani. But when you use free weights (dumbbells, barbells, and kettlebells), you use a much wider range of muscles, including core muscles and others that help with stability and balance. A trainer will help you choose the correct type and size of free weight, based on your abilities and goals. Because free weights allow a greater range of motion, you need good body awareness to stay safe.
                
                
                Always make sure to stand up straight and tall before starting any standing strength moves, says Daryanani. Most gyms and health clubs have mirrors that you can use to get feedback on your form as you exercise. Even a basic body-weight exercise like a squat requires careful attention to body alignment to avoid straining your joints (see "The right and wrong way to do a squat").
                
                The right and wrong way to do a squat
                photos of a woman performing a squat exercise the correct way, and two incorrect ways, as described in the article
                
                Proper form is crucial to protecting yourself from injury and getting the most benefit from an exercise. A squat is a classic body-weight exercise that strengthens the lower body and core muscles in addition to improving your balance and posture. Here's the correct way to do this exercise without stressing the joints in your hips, knees, and ankles.
                
                Bend at your hips to work your gluteal (buttocks) muscles.
                Lean forward about 45° to keep your balance.
                Check that your knees are aligned and not rolling inward or outward.
                Keep your feet flat, with your heels on the floor.
                Don't let your knees go farther forward than your toes.
                Try not to let your thighs sink lower than parallel to the floor.
                Don't round your back; try to keep your spine in a straight line.
              
                
                Choosing a personal trainer
                Some gyms and fitness centers have personal trainers on staff or hire them as contractors. But many will come to your house and can devise an at-home workout plan for you, even if you don't own any machines or special equipment. Look for one who's accredited by one or more of these organizations:
                
                American Council on Exercise (ACE)
                American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)
                International Sports Sciences Association (ISSA)
                National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM).
                Ask about the person's training background, experience working with clients your age, and approach to designing client programs. Consider asking for references, especially from clients like you. Sign up for a few sessions at first to gauge how well you and the trainer work together before you commit to something longer.
                
                
                Prices vary widely, depending on where you live and possibly gym affiliations. The cost ranges anywhere from $75 to $125 per hour. You might be able to save a little money by hiring a trainer to do small group sessions with you and one or several of your friends who have similar fitness levels and goals.
                
                Another advantage to working with a trainer: a good one can make exercise feel like a fun challenge instead of a repetitive chore. "Getting someone in the right mindset is essential, and I find that positive energy can be very infectious," says Daryanani.</p>

                My Favorite Boots & Shoes for Traveling

            <span class="post-date">4 Dec 2022</span>
            <p class="post-decription">What are your favorite boots and shoes for traveling?
                While it depends on the type of trip – whether I’m doing a lot of walking on cobblestones through European streets, exploring a bit of outdoor terrain, or hiking through the backcountry – I’m particularly fond of a few brands of boots and shoes.
                
                Typically, all of my favorite shoes and boots come from the same few brands:
                
                Sorel – For rain/snow boots
                Danner – For hiking boots
                Frye – For stylish leather boots
                Dr. Martens – For city-style boots
                Free People – For boho styles
                Kizik – Hands-free slide-on sneakers
                Converse – My favorite sneakers since childhood
                Vans – Classic, casual sneakers</p>

                The Ultimate Clean Beauty Guide
            </a>
            <span class="post-date">18 May 2023</span>
            <p class="post-decription">What really is clean beauty and why is it important?

                Clean beauty refers to skincare and cosmetics that are made with ingredients that are not harmful to the consumer. Clean beauty products contain ingredients that are nourishing and made from natural or safe synthetic ingredients. This is crucial as there are many products out there that can disrupt the endocrine system (your hormone factory!), and aren’t good to be ingesting… especially in products that we often use daily.
                
                The key to living a cleaner, low-tox lifestyle is understanding that education and avoidance are always the first steps and that avoiding some harmful chemicals is always better than avoiding none. Do what you can!
                
                And it’s important to note that there are a lot of personal care products beyond beauty or skincare products that deserve a closer look, and that can have high levels of harmful toxins—like period products, candles, aerosol sprays, sunscreens, protein/fitness-related powders, and more.
                
                While the FDA regulates some things, many ingredients that could be harmful go unchecked; thus the need for a focus on “clean products” and checking out ingredients yourself.
                
                Here’s my ultimate guide to clean beauty with a few of my favorite clean beauty products!
                
                
                
                
                
                Why is Clean Beauty Important?
                The cosmetic and beauty world, especially in the United States, is not as regulated as other industries. This means that companies can use ingredients that are not actually safe for the skin or body, or use higher concentrations of ingredients without much data on the long-term effects.
                
                And before you think “well, everything is a chemical, what’s the point in trying to avoid them?” or “anything is ok in moderation”, the truth is that with most of these newly-developed chemicals, toxins, and contaminants, we just don’t know what “moderation” actually is, or how all of these chemicals REACT with each other when you’re exposed to so many in your normal, daily routine, and for long periods of time.
                
                Cosmetics and beauty supplies that millions of women and men use each day can cause cancer, infertility, endocrine disrupters, and so much more. Some products that people use every day, like deodorants which include aluminum zirconium, have been linked to increased risks of breast cancer.
                
                Carcinogens are cancer-causing chemicals and are found in many makeups and beauty care products. Many of these ingredients are banned in Japan and Europe, but not in the United States. To give you an idea of how few regulations the U.S. has on cosmetics, there are just a little over ten substances that are banned in the U.S. which is just a fraction compared to the 1,300 that are banned in Europe.
                
                This post isn’t meant to scare you, I just wanted to highlight some things that I learned and bring to your attention.
                
                You don’t have to throw away everything you use, if you’re able to gradually shift to cleaner products — I’d recommend it!
                
                
                
        
                LOLI is a great example of a clean beauty brand. LOLI stands for Living Organic Loving Ingredients and is the world’s first zero waste, organic, and MADE SAFE® certified skincare brand.
                
                LOLI Beauty’s multitasking products are upcycled from organic food supply, waterless, vegan, non-GMO, and cruelty-free. Going a step further, LOLI mindfully packages using recycled, recyclable, reusable, and garden compostable packaging. I love that most of the products are in glass containers—better for me, and for the environment.
                
            
                
                What to Look For and Avoid
                When Shopping for Clean Beauty Products
                There are a few red flag ingredients to keep an eye out for.
                
                Phthalates
                Fragrances can be made with many different substances that do not have to be listed since it is considered secret ingredient and phthalates are chemicals added to make fragrances last longer. These are commonly found in shampoos, perfumes, candles, air freshers, cleaning products, and scented personal care products. Phthalates can cause reproductive issues in both men and women, cancer, neurological issues, asthma, and diabetes.
                
                Parabens
                Parabens act as preservatives in many makeup and beauty products but have been shown to cause obesity, early-onset puberty, and harm to reproductive organs.
                
                Phenacetin
                Phenacetin can be found in hair products. This chemical was banned by the FDA to be used in drugs but is not banned in other products. Phenacetin can be linked to renal damage, anemia, and mammary tumors.
                
                Ethoxylated Agents
                Ethoxylated agents, which can be labeled as ceteareths, sulfates, or oleths, are often found in hair products to make them lather but can be harsh on the hair by stripping it.
                
                Formaldehyde
                Formaldehyde is found in keratin hair straighteners, nail polish, and makeup. Japan bans formaldehyde altogether while Europe states there should be no more than 5% in products. The United States, however, does not regulate the amount of formaldehyde found in products. Formaldehyde can cause cancer in humans.
                
                Mineral Oil
                Mineral oils like petrolatum and paraffin are found in lip balms and face lotions and they have been linked to cancer.
                
                Hydroquinone
                Hydroquinone is found in bleaches and has been shown to cause cancers, poor immune responses, and skin conditions.
                
                Unpurified Talc
                Talc can be in face powders and eye shadows. Purified talc can be safe, but unpurified talc can contain asbestos.
                
                Triclosan
                Triclosan is an antibacterial chemical that is found in hand sanitizers and body soap. It has been linked to skin cancer, liver fibrosis, and hormone disruption.
                
                PFAS
                Both Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) are found throughout cosmetics and body care products—they are a giant class of chemicals known as a “forever chemical”. They can affect fertility, changes in the immune system, and development, and can increase the risk of cancers and diseases.
                
                PEGS
                While the FDA classifies PEGs as generally safe for both food and cosmetic production, the process of making PEGs creates toxic byproducts, including measurable amounts of ethylene oxide and dioxane. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies both as human carcinogens, so I always choose to avoid PEGs when possible.
                
                Endocrine Disruptors
                Even though I switched to clean beauty products years ago, I became increasingly aware of “endocrine disruptors” once I started trying to get pregnant. Many chemicals, both natural and man-made, may mimic or interfere with the body’s hormones, known as the endocrine system.
                
                Endocrine disrupting chemicals have been linked to weight gain⁠, hormonal imbalance⁠s, gut dysbiosis⁠, diabetes, infertility, developmental and reproductive issues⁠—all of which tend to affect women most!
                
                
                For example, “BPA-free” has become essential when shopping for plastic products—BPA is a known endocrine disruptor that can specifically affect birth weights, miscarriage, and weaken the success of IVF treatments. But many “BPA-free” products can still contain bisphenols which leach endocrine-disrupting chemicals.
                

                The Environmental Working Group, or EWG, is a community that strives to help protect the environmental health of everyone. The easy-to-use EWG’s Skin Deep website and app allow consumers to search products or brands for their EWG rating.
                
                The best rating a product can have is the EWG verified stamp while the worst is a rating of 10.
                The website also has its own list of the best products which includes baby shampoo, skincare, shampoo, cosmetic brands, and even baby diapers and wipes.</p>
